			<p>Roast potatoes seem like an easy dish to make, but they are difficult to get perfectly right; crispy on the 
				and outside, and fluffy on the inside. The key is to extract as much moisture as possible from the potatoes before they are roasted in the oven.
		<p> The quantities in the recipe will serve four people, as a side dish.</p>	
				
			<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
				<li>1kg potatoes, I like Royal Blues</li>
				<li>0.5c oil, rice bran is a good choice, as it has a high smoke point</li>
				<li>Salt and pepper, for seasoning</li>
				<li>Fresh rosemary leaves (optional)</li>	
			</ul>

			<ol>
				<li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.</li>
				<li>Put the oil into a large roasting dish, and then put the roasting dish in the oven on the middle shelf.</li>
				<li> Peel the potatoes.</li>
				<li> Cut each potato into the size you would like to them to be. I cut mine into half, and then into half again.</li>
				<li> Place the potatoes in a large pot, and fill with cold water. Cover the pot with a lid, and put it on the stove over high heat.</li>
				<li>Eventually, the potatoes will come to the boil. Boil them for about 5-10 minutes, or until no resistance remains when they are prodded with a form.</li>
				<li>Drain the potatoes in a colander, and leave for a moment for the excess moisture to evaporate.</li>
				<li>While the potatoes are resting, put the pot you used for boiling the potatoes back on the stove. Turn the heat to medium.</li>
					<li>Put the potatoes back in the pot on the stove.</li>
					<li>Holding both handles, vigorously shake and turn the pot, so the surface of the potatoes is roughened. Put the pot back down on the heat for a moment, then repeat the shaking action one more.</li>
					<li>Remove the pot from the heat.</li>
					<li>Retrieve the roasting pan from the oven, and place on a heat proof surface.</li>
					<li>Facing the pot away from you, empty the potatoes into the roasting pan. <b>The oil will be extremely hot, so position yourself away from where the oil could splatter.</b></li>
					<li>Using a spoon, distribute the potatoes in the roasting pan so they are arranged in a single layer.</li>
					<li>Season with salt and pepper.</li>
					<li>Bake in the oven for 40 minutes.</li>
					<li>The potatoes will be done when they are golden and crispy.</li>
					<li>If you like, the potatoes can be tossed with some fresh rosemary leaves just prior to serving. I find that this is preferable to adding the rosemary in at the oven stage, as the herb becomes burnt and sharp tasting.</li>
