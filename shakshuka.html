					<ol>
						<li>Heat the oil or butter in a large frying pan with high sides. You will need a pan with high sides to accomodate the sauce and eggs.</li>
						<li>Over medium heat, saute the onion gently, without letting it become crisp or burnt. If you can afford the time to caramelise it, even better.</li>
						<li>Add the garlic, and stir in to the onion, making sure not that it doesn't burn too.</li>
						<li>Combine the spices in a small bowl, and then add the onions. Stir until the mixture is fragrant.</li>
						<li>In a bowl, separate the mince with your hands, so it will cook more evenly and equally in the pan. Increase the heat to high, and add the mince to the pan.</li>
						<li>Brown the mince, stirring continuously. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
						<li>Reduce the heat to low, and add the tomatoes. Simmer gently for 40 minutes. If the sauce seems dry, or is sticking, add 2-3T of water at a time.</li>
						<li>Add the soy sauce, and stir to combine.</li>
						<li>Stir the sauce, and arrange the surface with a spoon so it is even and flat. One at a time, crack each egg onto the surface of the sauce. Work around the perimeter of the pan, and then into the centre, so the eggs will not combine together.</li>
						<li>Poach the eggs until the whites are firm. If this is taking too long, cover the pan with the lid for a few minutes, checking frequently to make sure the yolks are not overcooking.</li>
						<li>To serve, use a large ladle to scoop out the eggs with the sauce and meat.</li>
						<li>Shakshuka is best served with a side of rice or cous cous, and a simple green salad.</li>
